This package creates a linear regression model embedded with missing data treatment. The linear regression model takes in a data frame of continuous and categorical variables, and output a list object containing relevant model information including the coefficient, t statistics, R Squared etc.

Compared to the default `lm` model, although the package is not so efficient and memory-saving when running the same huge data tasks, it allows for easy assess of the objects without calling addtional functions such as `summary()` and `cov`. Tutorial and description are provided to help users better access and understand the functionalities of the models and functions. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of HuiziYuHW3 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("huiziy/HuiziYuHW3")
```
## Structure
* `lm_func`: main function used to produce linear regression model prediction
  + input: 
    1. X - data frame of predictors (continuous and categorical; missing values allowed)
    2. y - vector of outcome
    3. na.action - "ignore" or "mean_impute"
  + output: a list object containing relevant model information
* `treat_na`: missing data treatment function. Embedded in the `lm_func`
  + input: 
    1. na.action - "ignore" or "mean_impute"
    2. data - data frame of predictors (continuous and categorical
    3. contains missing values); y - vector of outcome
  + output: completed data that can be used in linear model estimation
## Details of the Function

### Missing value treatment:

* `ignore`: same as the default `lm` function and `na.omit`: any rows containing missing values are dropped. The linear regression coefficient estimates are calculated using only rows with all complete observations. 
* `mean_impute`: performs mean imputation on the numeric variables, and mode imputation on categorical variables. If multiple modes are found for the categorical variable, the algorithm will randomly choose one. 

### Model output

The function `lm_func` will produce a list containing the following objects

* `fitted_values`: the fitted values obtain after coefficient estimation
* `residuals`: the residuals, which is calculated by taking the difference between observed outcome and fitted values
* `betas`: the coefficient estimates obtained from the linear model
* `beta_summary`: contains the coefficient estimate, standard errors of the coefficients, t_value and p_value
* `MSE`: Mean Squared Error
* `R_squared`: R squared
* `R_squared_adjusted`: R squared Adjusted
* `details`: additional information about the model that will be used in plotting. Including      + `beta_se`: the standard errors of the coefficient
   + `t_stat`: the t statistics of the betas
   + `p_stat`: the p stat of the coefficients (used for evaluating the significance of the coefficient)
   + `hat_mat`: the hat matrix (used for extracting leverage)

## Example

```r
library(MASS, quietly = TRUE)
data(Boston)
X = Boston[-ncol(Boston)]
y = Boston$medv
## Running the model
lm_object = lm_func(X,y)
## Extracting desired data model properties
lm_object$betas
```
